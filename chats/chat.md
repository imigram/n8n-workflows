Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with variables and their relationships. It involves the use of symbols, equations, and formulas to solve problems and model real-world situations.

Here are some key concepts in algebra:

1. **Variables**: Letters or symbols that represent unknown values.
2. **Constants**: Numbers that do not change value.
3. **Equations**: Statements that say two things are equal, often with variables on one side and constants on the other.
4. **Solutions**: The values of variables that make an equation true.

Algebraic expressions, equations, and formulas are used to:

* Solve problems involving unknowns
* Model real-world situations (e.g., population growth, interest rates)
* Make predictions and decisions based on data

Common algebra concepts include:

* Solving linear and quadratic equations
* Graphing lines and curves
* Working with functions and relationships between variables.
